Measure mode allows the probe tip to be \u00b19V tolerant and routable like any other node, but as of yet, the code to actually do anything with it is unwritten so it just connects to DAC 0 and outputs 3.3V just like it was in Select mode. But the DAC is much worse at matching the RP2350B's idea of what 3.3V is exactly , so probing will be flaky and may be off from the rows you're tapping in Measure . Connecting Rows Click the Connect button on the probe The logo should turn blue and the LEDs on the probe should also change Now any pair of nodes you tap should get connected as you make them. In connect mode, you're creating bridges (see the glossary ), so connections are made in pairs. When you've tapped the first node in a pair, the logo and Connect text on the probe will brighten to show that you're \" holding \" a connection, and the next thing you tap will connect to that first node . If you make a mistake while holding a connection, click the Connect button and it will clear it and take you back to the first node . If you click the Connect button while you're not holding a node , it will leave probe mode and bring you back into idle mode (rainbowy logo , all 3 probe LED s on.) Special Functions To connect to special functions , tap the corresponding pad near the logo, it will show you a menu on the breadboard and terminal to choose them. (This is an ASCII version of what will show on the breadboard LEDs) You can think of special functions just like any other node , the only difference is they're in a sort of \"folder\" so I didn't need to put a dedicated pad for each of them. The other 4 user pads will be more remappable in the future, but for now, top_guy is routable UART Tx and bottom_guy is routable UART Rx . The building pads are for overriding colors in idle mode (you'll see more about that in Idle Mode Interactions .) To get out of Connect mode, press the button again. Removing Rows Click the Remove button and the logo should turn reddish Now you can swipe along the pad s or tap them one at a time. Remember it only disconnects that node and anything connected to it directly, not everything on the net . So tapping say, row 25 that's connected to GND won't clear everything connected to GND , but tapping the - on the rails (for GND ) would. The special functions work the same way, tap the pad, pick one, and it will remove it. Click the button again to get out. Probe Notes Remember the probe is read by a resistive voltage divider , so putting your fingers on the pads (or the back sides of the 4 risers that connect those probe sense boards to the main board), or anything causing the probe tip not to be at a steady 3.3V will give you weird readings. If you can't seem to stop playing with the switch on the probe, run DAC calibration with $ and the 3.3V measure mode puts out should be fairly accurate enough for probing. The Click Wheel There are two kinds of presses, click (short press) and hold (long press). In general, a click (short) is a yes , and a hold (long) is a no / back / exit / whatever . When I say click , it's more of a diagonal slide toward the center of the board ( these encoders were meant to poke out just a little bit from the side of a tablet or whatever.) To get to the menu, click the button and scroll through the menus, click will bring you into that menu, hold will take you back one level. If you have trouble reading stuff on the breadboard LEDs, everything is copied to the Serial terminal and the OLED (talked about in OLED Section ), and adjusting the brightness may help; in the menus, it's Display Options > Bright > Menu and then scroll around until you find a level you like, then click to confirm. Idle Mode Net Highlighting The main thing is that there's a lot more interaction that can be done outside of any particular mode (like not probing and the logo is rainbowy, I'm gonna call this idle mode here until I think of a good name) Here's what's new (all of this is in idle mode): Basic Interactions Tapping nets highlights them as before, but there's a slightly different animation on the row you have selected from the whole net The click wheel scrolls through highlighting rows as if you tapped each one Row Selection Actions With a row selected, here's what you can do: Connect Button connect button will bring you into probing mode with the highlighted row already selected and then spit you back out to idle mode once you've made a connection to another row, or click connect again to exit Remove Button remove will briefly turn the row reddish warn (I need to settle on a good time for this, if it feels too short or long lmk), another remove press will remove that row (just like in probe mode, it removes the bridge it's in, so just things that have a direct connection to that row , not the whole net ), if you let it time out without pressing anything, the row will be unhighlighted. TL;DR, double click remove to remove, single click to unhighlight. Color Picker tapping the building top pad with something highlighted will open the color picker , (note: the color now follows the row instead of the net, so it can keep the colors even if you remove nets below it and they shift, this was soooo difficult until I realized I should do it by node ). Also the color assignments are saved to a file for each slot, so they should work after a reboot and when changing slots In the color picker , short clicking the probe buttons will zoom in and out, long press will confirm. The click wheel is similar, except you toggle zoom and scroll modes with short presses and long press to confirm Here's a demo on YouTube Measurement Display if the highlighted row is a measurement ( gpio input or adc ) it will print the state to serial and the oled Output Toggle if the highlighted row is an output ( gpio output , I'll eventually do dacs too) clicking the connect button will toggle it high / low . The remove button will just unhighlight the net (there were some choices here, like make each button assigned to high / low or allow removing them, but this felt like the best way after trying them all). I will eventually add a setting for the toggle repeat rate (set to 500ms now) and a way to set it freewheeling as a clock. this one feature is the reason I did this whole update. And it's worth it because it's sick af.","title":"Basic Controls"},{"location":"01-basic-controls/#basic-controls","text":"","title":"Basic Controls"},{"location":"01-basic-controls/#the-probe","text":"First, keep the switch on the probe set to Select Why Select mode?

If you have anything that's doing any measurement ( gpio input or ADC s), it'll stay up and live update if any of them change.

Rail Animations If it's a rail, those are animated and should be a continuous slow pulsing toward the top or bottom depending on the rail. ADC Animations ADCs are green at 0V, and go through the spectrum to red at +5V, and get whiter hot pink toward +8V. Negative voltages are kinda blue/icy and do that same thing with the \"cold\" colors towards -8V. GPIO Animations Input Mode GPIO as inputs are animated with a white pulsing (this might be broken in that FW release, I'm fixing that right now actually, and will just be purple/white) when floating, red for high, green for low Output Mode GPIO outputs will be either green or red depending on their state What's that BUFFER_IN - DAC_0 bridge that's always there? That gets added to power the probe LEDs , it's kinda weird, but to multiplex 3.3V, GND, LED data, 2 buttons, and a +-9V tolerant analog line over the 4 wires on a TRRS cable, the line powering those LEDs is shared. The connect / measure switch is a Dual Pole Dual Throw (DPDT) switch. The probe tip needs to be at a steady 3.3V to be read by the probe sense pads which is a big resistive divider sensed by a single ADC . When you have it in select mode, the probe tip is getting 3.3V from a GPIO on the RP2350B driven high , and the LEDs get their power from the analog line, which is ROUTABLE_BUFFER_IN connected to DAC 0 set to 3.3V. When you switch to measure mode, those roles get swapped, the LEDs are powered by that GPIO , and the probe tip is now ROUTABLE_BUFFER_IN . In the current firmware, that just stays at 3.3V so you can kinda sense pads in either mode (you may notice the sensing is a lot wonkier, that's because the DAC isn't perfectly calibrated to output exactly 3.3V.) But in the future, there will be some other stuff you can do in that mode treating it as an analog line (and of course, I'll forget to update this, if it's after like June 2025, double check this is still true.) Why am I using one of the precious two DACs and not another GPIO? The answer is switch position sensing. You may notice there's no obvious way for the Jumperless to know where the switch is set, so I had to get creative on this one. DAC 0 's output is hardwired to go through a current sense shunt resistor, so when DAC 0 is powering the probe LEDs , they'll be drawing some current I can measure with one of the INA219 s, and therefore I can be reasonably confident that the switch is in the select position. If you need both DAC s, you can just get rid of this connection and the probe LEDs won't light up, but other than aesthetics, it really has no effect on functionality. Or you connect ROUTABLE_BUFFER_IN to a GPIO and set it high and just lose the ability to sense where the switch is.
