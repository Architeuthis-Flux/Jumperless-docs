# What is it?

Jumperless V5 lets you prototype like a nerdy wizard who can see electricity and conjure jumpers with a magic wand. It’s an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for hardware, with an analog-by-nature RP2350B dev board, a drawer full of wires, and a workbench full of test equipment (including a power supply, a multimeter, an oscilloscope, a function generator, and a logic analyzer) all crammed inside a breadboard.

You can connect any point to any other using software-defined jumpers, so the four individually programmable ±8 V power supplies; ten GPIO; and seven management channels for voltage, current, and resistance can all be connected anywhere on the breadboard or the Arduino Nano header. RGB LEDs under each hole turn the breadboard itself into a display that provides real-time information about whatever’s happening in your circuit.

It's not just about being too lazy to plug in some jumpers. With software controlled wiring, the circuit *itself* is now [***scriptable***](08-micropython.md), which opens up a world of infinite crazy new things you could never do on a regular breadboard. Have a script try out every combination of parts until it does what you want (*à la* [evolvable hardware](https://evolvablehardware.org/)), automatically switch around audio effects on the fly, characterize some unknown chip with the part numbers sanded off, or don't bother with any of that and just [play Doom on it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWYWruUO0F4).

But more likely, you'll be using it to get circuits from your brain into hardware with so little friction it feels like you're just thinking them into existence. So yeah, wizard shit.
