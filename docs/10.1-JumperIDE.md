 # Jumperless Online (JumperIDE)

This page hosts **JumperIDE**, a custom fork of [ViperIDE](https://viper-ide.org/) tailored for Jumperless. It’s a browser-based MicroPython IDE so you can write, run, and debug scripts without leaving the docs.

## Use the IDE

The IDE runs in your browser. Connect your Jumperless via USB and use the in-page connection (e.g. WebSerial) to get a REPL, file manager, and editor.

## About JumperIDE

- **Fork:** [Architeuthis-Flux/JumperIDE](https://github.com/Architeuthis-Flux/JumperIDE) — ViperIDE with Jumperless-oriented defaults and tweaks.
- **Upstream:** [ViperIDE](https://viper-ide.org/) by Volodymyr Shymanskyy — MicroPython/CircuitPython IDE for web and mobile.

For full MicroPython workflow (including using the built-in REPL and `jumperless` module), see [MicroPython](08-micropython.md).

## Community scripts

JumperIDE can load a list of community scripts so you can open or add them from the **Scripts** tab in the side menu. The script index URL is:

- **Script index:** <https://docs.jumperless.org/scripts/index.json>

The index is a JSON file with a `scripts` array. Each entry has `name`, `description`, and `url` (direct link to the raw `.py` file). To add your own script, open a pull request that adds an entry to this repo’s `docs/scripts/index.json` (and optionally add the script file under `docs/scripts/` or link to a raw URL elsewhere).
