[Here are the 3D models](https://www.printables.com/model/1249365-jumperless-stand) for you to print your own stand for your Jumperless. It's extremely handy to have it propped up like this to read text on the breadboard. 

## Printing Tips

Yes, the model is at a weird angle, just drop it down in the slicer, if you want it to hold at a shallower angle, just drop the model through the bed a bit when you slice.

## Rubber Feet

These [stick-on rubber feet](https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-300-Piece-Adhesive-Rubber-Bumpers/dp/B087MG3G76) also make it a lot more solid on your desk (and having the different sizes lets you shim the angle by putting different ones on the front and back.)
