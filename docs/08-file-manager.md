# File Manager

The Jumperless has a built in File Manager which you can access in the menu with `/`, or enter `U` in the menu and Jumperless will mount as a USB Mass Storage drive called `JUMPERLESS` where you can edit files on the filesystem.

## Jumperless Kilo Text Editor

The File Manager also has text editor based off [**eKilo**](https://github.com/antonio-foti/ekilo)

### Editor Controls
- **Ctrl+S**: Save file
- **Ctrl+Q**: Quit editor
- **Ctrl+P**: Save and launch MicroPython REPL
- **Arrow keys**: Navigate cursor
- **Rotary encoder**: Move cursor horizontally
- **Click encoder**: Enter character selection mode (you can scroll through the letters on the OLED and click again to insert it)

### Character Selection With the Click Wheel and OLED
When using the rotary encoder in the editor:

- **Click encoder**: Enter character selection mode
- **Rotate encoder**: Cycle through available characters
- **Click encoder**: Confirm character selection
- **Wait 3 seconds**: Exit character selection mode

Yes, you could write code with just the click wheel and the OLED if you really wanted to.


### MicroPython Examples
The File Manager automatically creates example Python scripts in `/python_scripts/examples/`:

- **01_dac_basics.py**: DAC (Digital-to-Analog Converter) examples
- **02_adc_basics.py**: ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter) examples  
- **03_gpio_basics.py**: GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) examples
- **04_node_connections.py**: Node connection and routing examples
- **led_brightness_control.py**: LED brightness control
<!-- - **voltage_monitor.py**: Voltage monitoring utilities
- **stylophone.py**: Musical instrument example -->

You can trigger them to regenerate if you messed them up by deleting it with `x`, and then entering `m` to create new copies of any examples it doesn't see.


## USB Mass Storage

Enter `U` in the menu and Jumperless will mount as a USB Mass Storage drive called `JUMPERLESS` where you can edit files on the filesystem.

Keep in mind that file operations are pretty slow, so make sure to give it time to fully save files when you drop them onto the filesystem.

When you're finished `u` (or just eject the drive) will unmount the Mass Storage device.

You can also enter `Z` for a little debug menu

- **File navigation** with scrolling support
- **Real-time updates** as you navigate
